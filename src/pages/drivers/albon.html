        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Promising Start</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Born on March 23, 1996, in London, England, to a Thai mother and
          British father, Alexander Albon’s multicultural background brought him
          a unique identity in the world of motorsport. Albon made his mark in
          karting, achieving success on the international stage before
          progressing through the junior single-seater categories. His
          performances in Formula 2 in 2018, where he finished third in the
          championship, showcased his potential and earned him a seat in Formula
          One with Toro Rosso in 2019.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Challenges and Comebacks</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Midway through his rookie season, Albon was promoted to Red Bull
          Racing, where he impressed with his adaptability and ability to handle
          pressure. Despite showing flashes of brilliance, he faced challenges
          against a dominant teammate in Max Verstappen. After leaving the Red
          Bull seat at the end of 2020, Albon worked as a reserve driver,
          focusing on improving his craft and staying ready for a return.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Revival with Williams</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          In 2022, Albon joined Williams Racing, rejuvenating his Formula One
          career with consistent performances and a determined mindset. His
          ability to maximize results in a less competitive car demonstrated his
          resilience and racecraft. Albon’s journey reflects his unyielding
          dedication to the sport and his drive to establish himself as a force
          to be reckoned with on the Formula One grid.
