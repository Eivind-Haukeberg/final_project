        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Promising Start</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Pierre Gasly was born on February 7, 1996, in Rouen, France, and began
          karting at a young age. His career gained momentum in the junior
          categories, culminating in a championship victory in the 2016 GP2
          Series. Recognized for his speed and racecraft, Gasly joined the Red
          Bull Junior Team, which set the stage for his entry into Formula One.
          He debuted with Scuderia Toro Rosso (now AlphaTauri) in late 2017,
          impressing with strong performances that demonstrated his potential.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Red Bull and Redemption</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Gasly was promoted to Red Bull Racing in 2019, a move that came with
          high expectations. However, after a challenging first half of the
          season, he returned to Toro Rosso. This setback proved to be a turning
          point, as Gasly showcased remarkable resilience and determination. He
          achieved his maiden Formula One podium later that year in Brazil,
          finishing second. In 2020, Gasly delivered an unforgettable moment at
          the Italian Grand Prix, securing a historic win for AlphaTauri—his
          first Formula One victory and the team’s first since 2008.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Now racing for Alpine, Gasly continues to build on his reputation as a
          fighter on the grid. With a blend of experience, skill, and a proven
          ability to bounce back from challenges, he remains a formidable
          competitor. His journey is one of perseverance, and Gasly’s focus on
          consistency and results positions him as a key player for the future
          of Formula One.
