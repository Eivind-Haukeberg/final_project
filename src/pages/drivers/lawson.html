        <p class="team__info-text">
          Liam Lawson, born on February 11, 2002, in Hastings, New Zealand, is
          one of Formula One’s brightest young prospects. His racing career
          began in karting before he transitioned to single-seaters, where his
          skill quickly became evident. Lawson made waves in international
          competitions like the Toyota Racing Series, which he won in 2019, and
          FIA Formula 3, where he consistently showcased his raw speed and
          racecraft.

        <p class="team__info-text">
          Lawson joined the Red Bull Junior Team, aligning himself with one of
          the sport’s most successful development programs. His talent earned
          him a reserve driver role for Red Bull Racing and AlphaTauri, and in
          2023, he made his Formula One debut, filling in for an injured driver.
          Despite limited preparation, Lawson impressed with his composure and
          adaptability, gaining valuable experience and proving he belonged on
          motorsport's biggest stage.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Promising Future</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          With his determination and Red Bull's backing, Liam Lawson is poised
          for a successful Formula One career. Whether competing for a full-time
          seat or continuing to build his reputation, Lawson’s talent and work
          ethic make him a driver to watch as he navigates the challenges and
          opportunities of the Formula One grid.
