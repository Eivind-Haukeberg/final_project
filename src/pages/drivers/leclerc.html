          Born on October 16, 1997, in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Charles Leclerc
          showed early promise as a racing prodigy. He dominated karting
          championships before progressing through single-seaters, winning the
          GP3 Series in 2016 and the Formula 2 Championship in 2017. These
          successes paved the way for his Formula One debut with Alfa Romeo
          Sauber in 2018, where he quickly made an impression with his speed and
          maturity.

          Leclerc joined Scuderia Ferrari in 2019, becoming the youngest driver
          to race for the iconic team in over 50 years. In his debut season, he
          claimed two sensational victories at Spa-Francorchamps and Monza,
          cementing his status as Ferrari's rising star. Known for his fearless
          overtakes and exceptional qualifying performances, Leclerc has been
          instrumental in revitalizing Ferrari's competitiveness.

          As Ferrari's lead driver, Leclerc remains focused on bringing the
          championship back to Maranello. Combining raw speed with a deep
          understanding of racecraft, he continues to push the limits of his
          SF-23 car. With a strong following and undeniable talent, Leclerc is
          poised to achieve greatness and deliver on the legacy of Ferrari
          legends before him.
