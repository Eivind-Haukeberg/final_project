        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Promising Start in Motorsports</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Born on August 19, 1987, in Emmerich am Rhein, Germany, Nico
          Hülkenberg showed early promise in motorsport, excelling in karting
          before transitioning to single-seater racing. He won the 2009 GP2
          Series (now Formula 2) in his rookie season, a feat that solidified
          his reputation as one of the brightest talents of his generation. This
          success paved the way for his Formula One debut with Williams in 2010.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Solid Formula One Career</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Hülkenberg's career has been defined by consistent performances across
          multiple teams, including Williams, Force India, Sauber, Renault, and
          Haas. Known for his adaptability and technical understanding, he has
          often been a reliable asset for midfield teams. Despite his
          record-breaking 181 race entries without a podium finish, Hülkenberg
          remains respected for his qualifying speed, racecraft, and team
          contributions.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Resilient Return</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          After stepping away from a full-time Formula One seat in 2020,
          Hülkenberg made a series of impressive substitute appearances,
          showcasing his readiness and skill. His return to a full-time role
          with Haas in 2023 marked a new chapter in his career. With his wealth
          of experience, Nico Hülkenberg continues to prove his value on the
          grid, earning admiration as a resilient and dedicated competitor.
