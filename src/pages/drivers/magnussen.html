        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Rising Through the Ranks</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Born on October 5, 1992, in Roskilde, Denmark, Kevin Magnussen was
          destined for motorsport, following in the footsteps of his father, Jan
          Magnussen, a former Formula One driver. Kevin made a name for himself
          early on, excelling in junior categories, including a dominant
          championship victory in the 2013 Formula Renault 3.5 Series. His
          success earned him a Formula One debut with McLaren in 2014, where he
          impressed with a podium finish in his very first race.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Career of Persistence</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Magnussen's Formula One journey has been a story of resilience and
          determination. After stints with McLaren and Renault, he found a
          long-term home at Haas. Known for his aggressive driving style and
          unyielding spirit, he has consistently pushed the limits to extract
          the maximum from his machinery. His return to Haas in 2022 after a
          brief hiatus from Formula One highlighted his enduring commitment and
          adaptability.
