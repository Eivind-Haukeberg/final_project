          From Humble Beginnings to Formula One
        </h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Esteban Ocon was born on September 17, 1996, in Évreux, France. Raised
          in a modest family, Ocon’s journey to Formula One is a story of
          determination and sacrifice. His parents sold their home to support
          his karting career, a decision that paid off as Ocon quickly climbed
          the motorsport ladder. After winning the FIA Formula 3 European
          Championship in 2014, he secured a spot in Mercedes’ junior driver
          program, setting the stage for his Formula One debut.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Formula One Career and Breakthrough</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Ocon made his Formula One debut with Manor Racing in 2016 before
          joining Force India (later Racing Point). His strong performances
          against seasoned teammates earned him recognition as a consistent and
          competitive driver. After a brief absence from the grid in 2019, Ocon
          returned with Renault (now Alpine) in 2020, where he achieved a career
          milestone by winning the dramatic 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix. His
          victory highlighted his ability to capitalize on opportunities and
          perform under pressure.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Steady Presence on the Grid</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Now a key figure at Alpine, Ocon continues to demonstrate his skill
          and resilience. His partnership with Pierre Gasly marks a new chapter
          for the team, as they work together to elevate Alpine’s position in
          Formula One. With his tenacity and experience, Esteban Ocon remains a
          vital part of the sport and a source of inspiration for aspiring
          drivers.
