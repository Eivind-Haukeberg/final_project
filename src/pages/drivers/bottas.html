        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Promising Beginning</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Valtteri Bottas, born on August 28, 1989, in Nastola, Finland,
          showcased his talent early in karting before making waves in
          single-seater racing. After winning the Formula Renault Eurocup and
          Formula Renault Northern European Cup in 2008, he established himself
          as one of the brightest prospects in motorsport. His success in the
          GP3 Series in 2011 cemented his reputation, earning him a spot in
          Formula One with Williams in 2013.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Success with Mercedes</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Bottas joined Mercedes in 2017, stepping into one of the most
          competitive seats on the grid. Over his five seasons with the team, he
          contributed significantly to their dominance, helping secure multiple
          Constructors' Championships. Bottas claimed 10 Grand Prix victories
          and consistently finished at the sharp end of the championship
          standings, proving himself as a reliable and fast driver alongside
          Lewis Hamilton.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A New Chapter</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          In 2022, Bottas embarked on a new chapter with Alfa Romeo (formerly
          Sauber), bringing experience and leadership to the midfield team.
          Known for his calm demeanor and calculated driving, Bottas remains a
          key figure on the grid. His strong racecraft and resilience ensure
          that he continues to be a respected competitor, inspiring fans and
          fellow drivers alike.
