        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Rise to Stardom</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Born on January 7, 1985, in Stevenage, England, Lewis Hamilton began
          karting at the age of eight and quickly established himself as a
          prodigious talent. With an unparalleled determination and natural
          ability, Hamilton dominated junior racing categories, catching the
          attention of McLaren and Mercedes. In 2007, he made history as Formula
          One’s first Black driver, debuting with McLaren and almost winning the
          championship in his rookie season.

          Record-Breaking Career and Mercedes Era
        </h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Hamilton secured his first World Championship in 2008 with McLaren,
          cementing his place among the sport’s elite. A move to Mercedes in
          2013 proved transformative, ushering in an era of dominance. From 2014
          to 2021, Hamilton won six more championships, breaking numerous
          records, including the most pole positions and race victories in
          Formula One history. His consistent brilliance, adaptability, and
          fierce competition with rivals like Sebastian Vettel and Max
          Verstappen defined an era.

        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Beyond the Track</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Hamilton is not only celebrated for his on-track achievements but also
          for his advocacy for diversity and sustainability in motorsport. A
          vocal supporter of equality, Hamilton founded Mission 44, aimed at
          empowering underrepresented youth, and has pushed Formula One to
          address environmental challenges. As one of the most influential
          figures in sports, Lewis Hamilton’s legacy transcends racing,
          inspiring millions worldwide.
