        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Bold Entry</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Haas F1 Team was founded in 2014 by Gene Haas, a successful
          entrepreneur and owner of Haas Automation, a leading CNC machine tool
          manufacturer. The team officially entered Formula One in 2016,
          breaking a 30-year absence of American teams from the sport. Haas
          adopted an innovative model, collaborating with Ferrari for power
          units, technical support, and components, allowing it to focus
          resources on other competitive areas. Haas’ debut season was
          impressive, with Romain Grosjean scoring points in their very first
          race at the Australian Grand Prix. The team’s strong performance
          throughout the 2016 season marked a remarkable entry into the highly
          competitive world of Formula One.

        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Challenges and Resilience</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          After a promising start, Haas faced challenges in maintaining
          consistency. Budget constraints and technical difficulties often
          hindered the team’s progress. However, Haas demonstrated resilience,
          securing its best Constructors' Championship result of fifth place in
          2018, thanks to strong performances by Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen.
          The team experienced setbacks during the 2019 and 2020 seasons,
          struggling with car performance and reliability. Despite these
          hurdles, Haas remained committed to its vision of competing at the
          highest level, rebuilding its foundation for future success.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A New Chapter</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          In 2021, Haas underwent a significant transformation, bringing in a
          young driver lineup of Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin. The focus
          shifted toward long-term growth, with the team opting to invest in
          development for future seasons. In 2023, experienced drivers Nico
          Hülkenberg and Kevin Magnussen returned to provide valuable experience
          and leadership, signaling Haas’ intent to climb back into midfield
          contention. Operating out of Kannapolis, North Carolina, Haas remains
          committed to its unique business model, combining cost-efficiency with
          competitive ambition. The team’s collaboration with Ferrari continues
          to provide technical expertise, ensuring Haas remains a steady
          presence on the grid.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Haas F1 Team is poised to continue its journey in Formula One,
          striving for improved results and a consistent presence in the
          midfield. With an experienced driver lineup, strategic partnerships,
          and a resilient team culture, Haas is determined to showcase the
          fighting spirit of American motorsport.
