        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Founding and Early Success</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Williams Racing was founded in 1977 by Sir Frank Williams and Patrick
          Head, driven by a shared vision of building a championship-winning
          Formula One team. Success came quickly, with the team securing its
          first Constructors' and Drivers' Championships in 1980 with Alan
          Jones. By 1982, Williams had claimed a second Constructors' title,
          establishing itself as a formidable competitor in the sport. The
          team’s early years were defined by technical ingenuity and a
          relentless pursuit of excellence, which would become hallmarks of its
          identity.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Golden Era of Dominance</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          The 1980s and 1990s were Williams Racing’s golden era. The team
          partnered with engine suppliers like Honda and Renault, producing
          groundbreaking cars that dominated the grid. Drivers such as Nigel
          Mansell, Nelson Piquet, Alain Prost, and Damon Hill brought glory to
          the team, winning multiple championships. The FW14B, driven by Mansell
          in 1992, is one of the most iconic cars in Formula One history,
          featuring advanced active suspension technology that gave the team a
          significant competitive edge. Williams clinched nine Constructors'
          Championships and seven Drivers' Championships between 1980 and 1997,
          making it one of the most successful teams in the sport’s history.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Challenges in the Modern Era</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          The 21st century brought challenges for Williams Racing as the team
          struggled to compete against well-funded rivals. Despite these
          difficulties, moments of brilliance persisted, such as Pastor
          Maldonado’s unexpected victory at the 2012 Spanish Grand Prix. In
          recent years, Williams has embarked on a rebuilding journey, embracing
          new leadership and innovative strategies to reclaim its former glory.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          With its acquisition by Dorilton Capital in 2020 and a renewed focus
          on development, Williams Racing is poised for a resurgence. The team’s
          commitment to nurturing young talent, investing in cutting-edge
          technology, and leveraging its legacy of innovation positions it for a
          brighter future. Drivers like Alexander Albon and emerging talents
          reflect Williams’ dedication to revitalizing its competitive edge.
