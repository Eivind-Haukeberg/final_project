        <h3 class="team__info-heading">The Sauber Legacy</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Kick Sauber’s origins lie in Sauber Motorsport, a team founded in 1970
          by Peter Sauber in Hinwil, Switzerland. Originally competing in
          endurance racing, Sauber transitioned to Formula One in 1993, quickly
          earning respect for its technical ingenuity and competitive spirit.
          The team’s collaboration with engine suppliers like Mercedes and BMW,
          along with its ability to develop talent, cemented Sauber as a
          mainstay on the grid. Over the years, Sauber nurtured future champions
          like Kimi Räikkönen and Sebastian Vettel, showcasing its role as a
          vital part of Formula One’s ecosystem. Its dedication to innovation
          and development paved the way for the team’s evolution into Kick
          Sauber.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">The Kick Rebrand</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          In 2024, the team rebranded as Kick Sauber, embracing a bold new
          vision driven by its partnership with Kick, a dynamic global brand.
          The rebrand reflects a modern approach to racing while maintaining the
          engineering prowess and team culture that Sauber established over
          decades. Kick Sauber aims to merge its historic foundation with the
          vibrancy and ambition of a new era. With drivers Zhou Guanyu and
          Valtteri Bottas leading the charge, Kick Sauber combines youthful
          energy with seasoned experience. This balance positions the team as a
          formidable competitor in the ever-competitive midfield battle.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Technical Innovation and Swiss Precision</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Operating out of its state-of-the-art facility in Hinwil, Switzerland,
          Kick Sauber embodies precision and innovation. The team’s commitment
          to aerodynamics, chassis development, and hybrid power units ensures

        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Kick Sauber is on the verge of another major transformation. In 2026,
          the team will become Audi’s official works team, marking a new chapter
          in its illustrious history. Audi’s entry into Formula One represents a
          significant investment in sustainable hybrid technology, advanced
          engineering, and competitive excellence. This transition promises to
          elevate Kick Sauber to new heights, as the team takes on the challenge
          of competing at the front of the grid. With significant investments in
          development, a robust driver lineup, and a dedication to nurturing
          talent, Kick Sauber is well-equipped for this journey. The combination
          of Sauber’s precision, Kick’s dynamic vision, and Audi’s engineering
          expertise sets the stage for an exciting future.
