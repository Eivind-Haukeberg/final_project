        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Foundations as Toro Rosso and AlphaTauri</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Visa Cash App RB’s roots trace back to 2006, when the team was
          originally founded as Scuderia Toro Rosso. Toro Rosso served as Red
          Bull Racing’s junior team, providing a platform to develop young
          talent. Drivers like Sebastian Vettel, Daniel Ricciardo, and Max
          Verstappen began their careers with Toro Rosso, making it a key
          stepping stone in Formula One. In 2020, the team rebranded as
          AlphaTauri, aligning with Red Bull’s fashion brand. This era
          emphasized style, innovation, and competitiveness, with Pierre Gasly
          securing an unforgettable victory at the 2020 Italian Grand Prix.
