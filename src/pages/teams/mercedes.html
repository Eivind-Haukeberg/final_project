        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Legacy of Racing Excellence</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Mercedes-Benz has a storied history in motorsport, dating back to the
          early 1900s. The modern Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team was
          established in 2010, building on the legacy of its predecessor teams.
          With Michael Schumacher spearheading its early years, Mercedes laid
          the groundwork for future dominance, solidifying its place in Formula
          One with unmatched resources and ambition.

        <h3 class="team__info-heading">
          The Hybrid Era: Unprecedented Dominance
        </h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          The introduction of hybrid power units in 2014 marked the beginning of
          Mercedes’ unparalleled reign in Formula One. The team achieved an
          unprecedented streak of eight consecutive Constructors' Championships
          from 2014 to 2021, driven by the engineering marvels of their hybrid
          power units and aerodynamic designs. Lewis Hamilton, partnering with
          Valtteri Bottas and Nico Rosberg in different seasons, secured six
          Drivers' Championships during this period. The W11 and W12 cars
          exemplified Mercedes’ technical brilliance, setting benchmarks for
          speed and reliability.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Overcoming Challenges</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          As Formula One evolved with new regulations, Mercedes faced increased
          competition from rivals like Red Bull Racing. The team showcased
          resilience, adapting its strategies and innovating under pressure. The
          dramatic 2021 season, featuring a nail-biting title battle between
          Hamilton and Max Verstappen, tested Mercedes’ resolve and further
          demonstrated its capability to compete at the highest level.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Innovation and the Road Ahead</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Mercedes-AMG Petronas remains committed to sustainability and
          innovation, embracing the shift towards greener technologies in
          Formula One. The team’s focus on data-driven strategy, precision
          engineering, and nurturing young talent positions it to remain a key
          contender in the sport’s future. With George Russell joining the team
          alongside Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes is poised to continue its legacy of
          excellence.
