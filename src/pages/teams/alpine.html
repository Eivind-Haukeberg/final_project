        <h3 class="team__info-heading">The Renault Legacy</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Alpine F1 Team traces its origins back to Renault’s rich history in
          motorsport, dating to the 1970s. Renault entered Formula One in 1977,
          quickly establishing itself as a pioneer in turbocharged engines. Over
          the decades, Renault achieved immense success, powering
          championship-winning cars for legendary drivers like Alain Prost and
          Fernando Alonso. The Renault team transitioned into Alpine in 2021,
          named after Renault’s iconic performance brand. This change signaled a
          new chapter, highlighting a commitment to modernity, style, and
          success in Formula One.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Fresh Identity</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          The rebranding to Alpine brought a fresh look to the grid, with the
          team adopting a striking blue livery inspired by the French flag.
          Alpine entered the 2021 season with an experienced driver lineup of
          two-time world champion Fernando Alonso and French talent Esteban
          Ocon. One of the team’s defining moments came during the 2021
          Hungarian Grand Prix, where Ocon secured his maiden Formula One
          victory. Alonso’s masterclass in defense against Lewis Hamilton in
          that race underscored Alpine’s ability to punch above its weight,
          earning admiration from fans and competitors alike.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Engineering Excellence</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Operating out of Enstone, England, and Viry-Châtillon, France, Alpine
          combines world-class chassis development with innovative engine
          design. The team’s hybrid power units are a testament to Renault’s
          engineering expertise, balancing performance and efficiency. With
          significant investments in infrastructure and a focus on data-driven
          strategies, Alpine aims to challenge the top teams on the grid.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">The Road Ahead</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Alpine’s ambition is clear: to become a consistent frontrunner in
          Formula One. With Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly as their current
          driver lineup, the team is blending homegrown French talent with
          global engineering excellence. Alpine’s commitment to sustainability
          and pushing technological boundaries positions it as a team prepared
          to thrive in the future of Formula One.
