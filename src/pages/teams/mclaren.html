      <!-- TEAM INFORMATION -->

        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Origins and Early Success</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          McLaren Racing was founded in 1963 by New Zealand driver Bruce
          McLaren. Competing in its first Formula One race in 1966, the team
          quickly made its mark. Bruce McLaren’s visionary leadership and
          technical ingenuity laid the groundwork for success, and by the 1970s,
          McLaren was a championship contender. The team secured its first
          Constructors' Championship in 1974, with Emerson Fittipaldi clinching
          the Drivers' Championship that same year, followed by James Hunt’s
          iconic 1976 title.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">The Senna-Prost Era</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          The late 1980s marked McLaren’s golden age, with the legendary pairing
          of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. Under the leadership of Ron Dennis
          and powered by Honda engines, McLaren dominated the sport, winning
          four consecutive Constructors' Championships from 1988 to 1991. The
          MP4/4 car, which achieved 15 wins out of 16 races in 1988, remains one
          of the most dominant cars in Formula One history. The rivalry between
          Senna and Prost captivated fans and solidified McLaren’s place as a
          motorsport giant.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Challenges and Resilience</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          McLaren’s success continued into the late 1990s and early 2000s, with
          Mika Häkkinen winning back-to-back Drivers' Championships in 1998 and
          1999. However, the team faced challenges in the hybrid era, struggling
          to compete with dominant teams like Mercedes and Red Bull Racing.
          Despite these setbacks, McLaren’s spirit of innovation and resilience
          has kept it in the mix. A renewed focus on partnerships, such as the
          collaboration with Mercedes engines, and talented drivers like Lando
          Norris and Oscar Piastri have signaled a promising resurgence.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Bright Future</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          McLaren’s commitment to excellence and its legacy of innovation
          continue to drive the team forward. With state-of-the-art facilities,
          a data-driven approach, and a focus on sustainability, McLaren is
          poised for a new era of success. The team’s vibrant mix of youth and
          experience in its driver lineup and a bold approach to design and
          strategy ensure that McLaren remains a beloved and competitive force
          in Formula One.
