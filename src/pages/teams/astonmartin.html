        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Storied Brand with Racing Roots</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Aston Martin’s history in motorsport dates back to the 1920s, where
          the brand first competed in endurance racing. The luxury British
          manufacturer made its Formula One debut in 1959, though the campaign
          was short-lived. Fast forward to 2021, and Aston Martin officially
          returned to Formula One, reviving its legacy under the stewardship of
          Lawrence Stroll. This marked the transformation of Racing Point into
          Aston Martin F1 Team, blending a storied heritage with cutting-edge
          innovation.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Modern Renaissance</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          The rebranded Aston Martin F1 Team entered the 2021 season with a
          renewed sense of purpose. Boasting drivers like four-time world
          champion Sebastian Vettel and Canadian talent Lance Stroll, the team
          aimed to compete at the highest level. The AMR21, Aston Martin’s first
          car of its new era, showcased a commitment to performance and
          engineering brilliance, capturing podium finishes and building a
          strong foundation for the future. In 2023, Fernando Alonso joined the
          team, bringing his experience and fierce determination to Aston
          Martin. His podium finishes early in the season reignited the team’s
          momentum and inspired its growing fanbase.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Engineering Brilliance and Ambition</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Aston Martin’s state-of-the-art headquarters in Silverstone, England,
          serves as a hub for innovation. With investments in advanced
          facilities and a focus on aerodynamics and power unit optimization,
          the team is determined to challenge Formula One’s dominant forces.
          Aston Martin’s collaboration with Mercedes for engines and technical
          support has further bolstered its competitiveness on the grid.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Aston Martin Formula One Team is on a mission to climb to the top of
          the Constructors' Championship. With a focus on sustainability,
