      <!-- TEAM INFORMATION -->
      <section class="team__info">
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">A Storied Beginning</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Founded in 1929 by Enzo Ferrari, Scuderia Ferrari initially served as
          a racing team for Alfa Romeo cars before transitioning to
          manufacturing its own. When Formula One began in 1950, Ferrari was a
          natural participant. Ferrari achieved its first Drivers' Championship
          in 1952 with Alberto Ascari, igniting a legacy of success that has
          made the Prancing Horse emblem synonymous with motorsport greatness.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Golden Years of Dominance</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Ferrari’s golden eras have been defined by legendary drivers and
          revolutionary cars. Niki Lauda’s triumphs in the 1970s and the
          technical brilliance of cars like the 312 T solidified Ferrari’s place
          as a dominant force. The team reached new heights in the early 2000s
          under the leadership of Jean Todt, Ross Brawn, and Michael Schumacher.
          From 2000 to 2004, Ferrari won five consecutive Constructors' and
          Drivers' Championships, with the F2004 becoming one of the most
          successful cars in Formula One history.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Challenges and Comebacks</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Despite its success, Ferrari has faced challenges over the years,
          often caught in fierce rivalries with teams like McLaren, Mercedes,
          and Red Bull Racing. While the team has struggled to recapture its
          dominance in the modern era, moments of brilliance from drivers like
          Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel, Charles Leclerc, and Carlos Sainz
          have kept Ferrari firmly in the fight for podiums and victories.
          Ferrari’s 2022 resurgence highlighted its ability to adapt and
          innovate, showing glimpses of a return to form.
        </p>
        <h3 class="team__info-heading">Vision for the Future</h3>
        <p class="team__info-text">
          Ferrari’s legacy is built on passion, and its vision for the future is
          no different. With a renewed focus on engineering excellence and
          strategic execution, Ferrari is determined to bring championships back
          to Maranello. The team’s commitment to sustainability and Formula
          One’s evolving landscape ensures Ferrari remains not just a competitor
          but a standard-bearer for the sport’s future.
